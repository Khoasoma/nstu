> **AI-assisted development:** NSTU is developed with AI assistance; all changes remain human-reviewed and auditable in public source history.

NSTU is a free and open-source classroom and computer-lab management project
for Windows. It is designed around a centralized teacher server, lightweight
student clients, authenticated control commands, chat, low-bandwidth client
screen snapshots, and teacher-screen broadcast over a local network.

## Recent updates

The `feature/zero-touch-enrollment` branch adds a batch of reliability and
classroom-UX changes (pending review on [PR #3](https://github.com/nekoo-moe/nstu/pull/3)):

- **Service setup & upgrades** — each `ChangeServiceConfig2W` recovery step is
  applied and reported individually with its Win32 error; `nstu-service
  --prepare-update` provides a Managed-mode-safe maintenance stop; NSIS
  same-role upgrades stage/rename/roll back the program payload while preserving
  `DataRoot` and `HKLM\Software\NSTU`.
- **Pairing** — an independent `WinsockRuntime` is held across the pairing TCP
  handshake (fixes "TCP socket creation failed" after discovery released the
  last Winsock reference); the "Add computers" window is persistent and shows
  live probe/beacon counters.
- **Chat** — client→server messages are transmitted over the control channel
  and stored in a per-client transcript with sender labels; incoming teacher
  messages are labelled `Teacher:` on the client.
- **Monitoring** — every online computer is snapshotted automatically for the
  class view (no per-machine Start click); the teacher broadcast is captured at
  1280×720 for legible text.
- **Annotation** — an eraser tool was added, and drawing is restricted to Focus
  mode; the ribbon's manual snapshot controls were removed.
- **Reboot-to-restore** — the "Enable reboot-to-restore" action is disabled with
  a reason when a client has reported an unsupported Windows edition.
- **UI** — minimizing the manager keeps it on the taskbar instead of hiding to
  the system tray.

### Verification (2026-09-26)

- Full MinGW/UCRT64 build clean; 38/38 unit tests pass.
- On a Windows client VM the updated service and agent were installed
  (`nstu-service --install`) and the client **reconnected to the teacher server
  automatically after the LAN IP changed** — both host and client moved to a new
  subnet after an internet restart, and authenticated re-discovery brought the
  client back online without re-pairing. Automatic class-view snapshots resumed
  with no operator action.
- Interactive teacher-side checks (chat transcript, eraser, broadcast) still
  need to be exercised through the manager UI.

## Why NSTU exists

NSTU grew from regret at seeing schools rely on unlicensed classroom software.
Software obtained from untrusted sources can be modified, exploited, or used to
turn lab computers into cryptocurrency-mining infrastructure without the
school's knowledge. At the same time, stronger copyright enforcement in
Vietnam can make it harder for schools with limited budgets to equip and manage
computer rooms legally.

We are building NSTU as a practical alternative: free to obtain, open for
inspection, easy to install, and designed with security and low-resource
hardware in mind. NSTU uses the MIT License. Schools, teachers, businesses, and
individuals may use, study, modify, and redistribute it, including for
commercial purposes, as long as the copyright and license notice is retained.

Open source does not automatically make software secure. NSTU therefore keeps
its threat model and unfinished production work public in
[SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) and [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Intended capabilities

- Manage 50 or more Windows clients from one teacher workstation.
- Monitor a room through bounded JPEG snapshots captured every 5-10 seconds,
  avoiding a continuous per-client video load on the classroom switch.
- Lock or unlock clients, draw on a selected student's screen through a
  click-through overlay, and broadcast periodic teacher-screen snapshots.
- Explicitly start and stop remote control for one selected client. Mouse
  movement/clicks are sent from the preview using normalized coordinates, and
  typed ASCII text can be dispatched from the focused remote-keyboard field.
- Retain the native Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) allowlist foundation for a
  future administrator-managed website policy. The unified installer and
  diagnostics helper do not currently expose policy controls.
- Retain H.264 multicast/unicast foundations for a future optional continuous
  broadcast mode without making it the default monitoring path.
- Show a responsive wall of the latest client snapshots, plus focused
  telemetry, controls, and chat for one client.
- Optionally retain a bounded, privacy-filtered server diagnostic history in
  memory and let a technician review it before manually creating a public
  GitHub Issue. Collection and error prompts are independently controllable;
  no report is uploaded automatically.
- Snapshot delivery is bounded to JPEG images up to 480x270 and 60 KiB. The
  teacher UI decodes each generation once, retains only the newest immutable
  payload, and reports malformed frames without retrying them every render
  frame.
- Run a small Windows service and native Win32 tray/chat agent on each client.
- Authenticate control and video traffic without JSON, XML, Electron, or a
  custom kernel driver.
- Keep secrets, dumps, captures, and runtime state local and outside Git.

## System requirements

The following values are project targets and still require validation on a
real 50-client lab.

| Role | Baseline target | Network |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server | Windows 10/11 x64, 6 GiB RAM minimum, 8 GiB recommended, 512 MiB free disk; i5-6400-class CPU is a performance reference only | Wired Gigabit Ethernet recommended |
| Client | Windows 10/11 x64, 6 GiB RAM minimum, 8 GiB recommended, 512 MiB free disk; i5-6400-class CPU is a performance reference only | Wired Ethernet recommended |
| Router/switch | Standard Ethernet switching/routing for authenticated TCP snapshots; IGMP snooping and an IGMP querier are optional future-video requirements | One controlled LAN/VLAN for the first deployment |

For a server supervising 50 or more devices, 16 GiB RAM and an SSD are prudent
until the 8 GiB recommended baseline has passed long-duration hardware testing. Intel HD
Graphics 530 is a baseline hardware-acceleration target, not a guarantee across
all driver versions.

Diagnostics report the CPU model, architecture, and physical/logical core
counts for technicians, but processor identity and topology never block the
installer. Validate CPU suitability with the actual NSTU workload because VM
topology, firmware, and Windows reporting can differ from the processor name.

## Build And Setup Flags

The Windows presets build either a Debug or Release configuration. Debug keeps
symbols and enables the default test targets; Release is the pre-release
configuration used for packaging.

```powershell
cmake --preset windows-debug
cmake --build --preset windows-debug
ctest --preset windows-debug

cmake -S . -B build-release -G "MinGW Makefiles" `
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNSTU_ENABLE_WERROR=ON `
  -DNSTU_BUILD_CLIENT=ON -DNSTU_BUILD_SERVER=ON `
  -DNSTU_BUILD_SETUP=ON -DNSTU_BUILD_VIDEO=ON -DNSTU_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build-release --parallel 4
```

The main CMake switches are:

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\|Release` | generator-dependent | Select debug symbols or optimized release binaries |
| `NSTU_BUILD_CLIENT=ON\|OFF` | `ON` | Build `nstu-service`, `nstu-agent`, and provisioning tools |
| `NSTU_BUILD_SERVER=ON\|OFF` | `ON` | Build the teacher server and its UI |
| `NSTU_BUILD_SETUP=ON\|OFF` | `ON` on Windows | Build the `nstu-diagnostics` helper used by the installer and boot checks |
| `NSTU_BUILD_VIDEO=ON\|OFF` | `ON` | Build DXGI, Media Foundation, and video transport components |
| `NSTU_BUILD_TESTS=ON\|OFF` | `ON` | Build the unit/integration test executables |
| `NSTU_SERVER_USE_IMGUI=ON\|OFF` | `ON` | Enable or disable the Dear ImGui server executable |
| `NSTU_ENABLE_WERROR=ON\|OFF` | `OFF` | Treat compiler warnings as errors; recommended for release validation |
| `NSTU_ENABLE_PACKAGING=ON\|OFF` | `ON` | Enable unified NSIS packaging targets |

For technician setup validation without building the client or server:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build-setup -G "MinGW Makefiles" `
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNSTU_BUILD_SETUP=ON `
  -DNSTU_BUILD_CLIENT=OFF -DNSTU_BUILD_SERVER=OFF `
  -DNSTU_BUILD_VIDEO=OFF -DNSTU_BUILD_TESTS=OFF `
  -DNSTU_ENABLE_WERROR=ON
cmake --build build-setup --target nstu-diagnostics
```

The server runtime accepts `--language=en`, `--language=vi`, `--dark`, and
`--graphics-debug`. These select the initial language/theme and request the
Direct3D 11 debug layer, respectively. Language, Appearance, and Screen
refresh controls are also available from the dashboard `Settings` section.
Screen refresh is the bounded snapshot interval, from 5 to 10 seconds.

The unified installer opens with an explicit role choice: `Install for Client`
or `Install for Server`. There is no supported `Both` installation because the
roles use different lifecycle and port responsibilities. The installer invokes
`nstu-diagnostics` sequentially. Technicians can also run it directly with
`--target=client|server`, `--server-ip=...`, `--server-port=...`, `--installer`,
`--boot-check`, `--auto-close`, and `--log=...`.

The separate `Diagnostics` popup inside `nstu-server.exe` reports DXGI adapters
and vendors, feature level, Desktop Duplication support, WARP fallback state,
and bounded recent HRESULT events. If graphics initialization fails before the
server UI can open, a native Windows message box displays the recorded failure.

Optional diagnostic collection is configured under server `Settings`. It is
disabled by default, stores at most 64 sanitized events in process memory, and
clears them when disabled or when the server exits. An optional error prompt
opens a complete report preview. `Copy and open GitHub` does not submit data: it
copies the reviewed report and opens the public Issue form for a technician to
paste and submit manually. See [Optional diagnostics](docs/TELEMETRY.md) for the
field allowlist and privacy boundary.

#### Server graphics diagnostics

Open `Diagnostics` in the server navigation bar to inspect the graphics
environment without starting a client stream. The popup reports every DXGI
adapter (including NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Microsoft/software adapters), selected
adapter and feature level, Desktop Duplication availability, and the number of
hardware H.264 Media Foundation encoders registered by Windows. It also keeps
a bounded timestamped event log containing device-creation, swap-chain resize,
and `Present`/device-removal HRESULTs. `Refresh` reruns the probes; it does not
change system policy or install drivers.

Server D3D11 initialization explicitly tries non-software adapters and then
falls back to WARP if hardware creation fails. This keeps the diagnostics UI
usable on machines with a missing or incompatible display driver. When
`--graphics-debug` is supplied, NSTU requests the D3D11 debug layer and records
if Windows does not provide it before retrying without the layer. If a driver
resets or removes the device, the failure HRESULT and
`ID3D11Device::GetDeviceRemovedReason()` value are recorded and the status bar
directs the operator to `Diagnostics`.

The Intel Core i5-11400F is an F-series processor and has no integrated GPU.
The server therefore requires a working discrete adapter (or WARP as a slow
diagnostic fallback). NVIDIA and AMD acceleration is supported through the
native DXGI/D3D11 and Windows Media Foundation hardware paths when the vendor
driver exposes them; CUDA, NVENC SDK, and AMD AMF are not required runtime
dependencies. Encoder availability depends on the installed driver and Media
Foundation registration, so capture the diagnostics popup before reporting a
streaming crash.

## Local resource benchmark

The following measurements are an indicative developer-machine check, not the
required 50-client production benchmark. They were recorded on September 1,
2026 from commit `f183e42`, using `build-verify/server/nstu-server.exe` with an
empty client registry and no snapshot or broadcast traffic.

Test machine: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X (8 cores/16 logical processors), 15.9 GiB RAM,
SSD storage, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER, and Windows 11 Pro build 26200.

| Scenario | CPU, total machine capacity | Working set | Private memory | Method |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Dashboard visible, idle | 0.725% average, 2.336% p95 | 53.54 MiB average, 54.50 MiB maximum | 117.95 MiB average, 118.83 MiB maximum | 120 one-second samples after a 10-second warm-up |
| Window closed to tray, idle | 0.023% average, 0.289% maximum | 52.48 MiB average, 53.00 MiB maximum | 120.60 MiB average, 121.06 MiB maximum | 60 one-second samples after a 5-second warm-up |

The empty-room run produced no application snapshot payload, so it is not a
live bandwidth benchmark. The table below is the worst-case JPEG payload model
from the implemented 60 KiB frame cap. It assumes every frame reaches that cap
and excludes authenticated-command, TCP/IP, Ethernet, retransmission, and other
control-traffic overhead.

| Snapshot traffic | 5 second interval | 7 second interval | 10 second interval |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| One client, one direction | 0.098 Mbps | 0.070 Mbps | 0.049 Mbps |
| 50-client room monitoring, inbound | 4.92 Mbps | 3.51 Mbps | 2.46 Mbps |
| Teacher broadcast to 50 clients, current per-client TCP path | 4.92 Mbps | 3.51 Mbps | 2.46 Mbps |
| Monitoring and teacher broadcast together | 9.83 Mbps | 7.02 Mbps | 4.92 Mbps |

These values are ceilings for the current periodic snapshot mode, not measured
switch throughput. Actual JPEGs can be smaller, while wire overhead makes each
transmission slightly larger. The future continuous H.264 path requires its own
measured rate-control and multicast/unicast benchmark.

The current release decision is to keep continuous H.264 monitoring deferred.
Periodic snapshots are the supported classroom path; H.264 must not be enabled
or advertised until the multi-client switch, decoder, recovery, and security
matrix has passed.

Ten launches in the same Windows session reached a responsive top-level window
in 191.8 ms median and 215.4 ms average. The minimum was 187.4 ms, the maximum
was 435.1 ms, and the first measured launch was 435.1 ms. This is application
launch latency with the OS already running; it is not a Windows reboot-to-ready
measurement.

For context, project-owner-supplied figures for other classroom-management
applications on the same Ryzen 7 5700X configuration are 11-12% average CPU
with peaks up to 20%, approximately 820 MB-1.1 GB RAM with peaks up to 1.3 GB,
30-40 Mbps while streaming, and about 32 seconds for boot and manager startup.
Those figures were not independently reproduced during this run, so differences
in workload and measurement method still prevent a strict apples-to-apples
comparison. The supplied systems were also described as removable by students.
NSTU's removal behavior was not tested in this resource benchmark; it remains
part of the administrator-policy, reboot, and Windows deployment validation
matrix.

### Reported i5-6400 follow-up

Reported an approximate NSTU run on the target Intel
Core i5-6400 system. These values did not include raw samples, duration, client
count, or workload details, so they are preliminary rather than definitive.

| Metric | NSTU on i5-6400 | Comparison and reduction |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| CPU | 4-12% | No same-i5 CPU baseline for the other application was supplied. Against its earlier 11-12% Ryzen average only as context, NSTU's 4% low end is 7-8 percentage points, or 63.6-66.7%, lower; the 12% high end overlaps the reference, so no guaranteed CPU reduction can be claimed. |
| RAM | Approximately similar to the NSTU Ryzen run | Results were similar across machines, but no definitive i5 memory figure was recorded. |
| Integrated GPU | 11% | The other application used 34% on the integrated GPU. NSTU was 23 percentage points lower, a 67.6% relative reduction, using about 32.4% of the comparison application's GPU load. |

### Reported client measurements at Vung Tau Junior High School

Teachers at Vung Tau Junior High School conducted and permitted the following
client-side checks on three devices with the same Intel Core i5-6400
configuration. These are approximate averages from three tests, not a
definitive production benchmark; the workload, capture scene, drivers, and
network can change the result.

| Client state | Approx. RAM | CPU | GPU / capture detail |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Snapshot capture and running service | 44 MB | no more than 7% | 11% iGPU / 6% CPU in the paired GPU/CPU sample |
| Watching a server stream with overlay (1080p/60 fps) | 96 MB | 11% | 27% iGPU / 19% CPU |
| Drawing directly on the student machine | 72 MB | not recorded | Overlay drawing workload |
| Streaming the student screen to the server (720p/30 fps) | 65 MB | not recorded | 25% iGPU / 16% CPU |

The client results complement the server measurements above. They do not claim
that every i5-6400 machine or every classroom workload will match these values.

### Deep Freeze removal observation

The NSTU client removal test at Vung Tau indicates that normal Deep Freeze
administration is required. The machine must be booted Thawed, the Deep Freeze
console opened normally, protection disabled, and Windows restarted before the
client can be completely removed; the uninstaller then requires its own restart
to finish stopping the service and deleting files. Without opening Deep Freeze
and disabling protection, removal is effectively blocked. This remains an
observational field report, not a claim that every Deep Freeze edition behaves
identically.

### Cooperation and test sites

The following schools are cooperating with NSTU as project partners or are being
evaluated for cooperation. Additional test results are still being collected.

The logo files in `docs/assets/partners/` are background-cleaned copies of the

Use `tools/production/collect-benchmarks.ps1` for longer runs. Results with 5,
7, and 10 second snapshot intervals, real clients, network traffic, raw CSV,
and a documented workload on the target i5-6400 hardware are still required
before making production resource claims.

## Recommended network layout

```text
Teacher PC (NSTU Server)
          |
     Gigabit Ethernet
          |
Ethernet switch / router (TCP snapshots; IGMP optional for future H.264)
     |            |             |
 Client 01     Client 02      Client 50+
```

Before a production deployment:

1. Put the server and clients on the same trusted VLAN or subnet for the first
   rollout.
2. Reserve a stable server address outside the DHCP pool where possible. Keep
   the router/gateway at `.1` and use a separate address such as `.10` for the
   teacher server.
3. Use a managed switch or router where practical. IGMP snooping and one IGMP
   querier are required only for a future continuous H.264/multicast trial;
   the supported snapshot path uses ordinary authenticated TCP connections.
4. Do not expose NSTU control or video traffic directly to the internet.
5. Prefer wired Ethernet. If Wi-Fi is used for testing, disable access-point
   client isolation and confirm the switch/AP can sustain the expected TCP
   snapshot traffic.
6. For snapshot-only deployment, an ordinary switch is sufficient if it meets
   the measured client count and uplink capacity. Do not enable multicast just
   to make discovery work. If the optional H.264 trial is enabled later,
   validate IGMP snooping, querier, flooding, and unicast fallback separately.
7. Keep Windows Firewall enabled. TCP `47001` is the required authenticated
   control and snapshot port, and UDP `47001` handles authenticated same-VLAN
   server address recovery. UDP `47000` is reserved for the optional future
   continuous-video transport and should remain closed unless that feature is
   explicitly enabled. Limit rules to the classroom VLAN and required
   executable; do not create broad internet-facing rules.

After enrollment, a client treats the stored server IPv4 address as a cache. If
that endpoint fails, it broadcasts a PSK-authenticated discovery request on the
same VLAN, performs the normal mutual TCP handshake with the candidate, and
stores the new address only after authentication succeeds. A server MAC address
may be used by the router for DHCP reservation, but NSTU never treats an IP or
MAC address as proof of server identity. Broadcast recovery does not cross a
router, so separate VLANs still require stable addressing or managed routing.

Cross-VLAN multicast is outside the supported snapshot deployment. If a future
continuous-video trial needs it, configure multicast routing intentionally and
validate it as a separate network change.

## Install the current test build

Nightly installers are available on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/Khoasoma/nstu/releases). They are unsigned
development artifacts and may trigger Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. Verify
the release origin and SHA-256 digest before running them:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\nstu-*-setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

### Server

1. Download `nstu-<version>-setup.exe` from the latest pre-release.
2. Run the unified installer, select **Install for Server**, and accept the
   Windows elevation prompt if requested.
3. To use the server immediately without signing out, launch it once:

   ```powershell
   & "$env:ProgramFiles\NSTU\server\nstu-server.exe"
   ```

The installer registers `NSTU Server` as a machine startup application. It
launches `nstu-server.exe` automatically in the interactive teacher session
whenever a user signs in to Windows; it intentionally remains a desktop app,
not a Session 0 Windows service. Minimizing or closing the window keeps it in
the notification area. Choosing **Exit** stops it until it is launched manually
or the next sign-in. The same installer's diagnostics helper can be run later
to repeat hardware and network checks while the machine is thawed.

To remove the server, use Windows **Installed apps** or the server uninstaller.
The first invocation stages removal and requires a restart; it does not remove
the service, process, or package files. After reboot it force-terminates the
installed `nstu-server.exe`, removes the server and diagnostics files, and
schedules any remaining locked files for a later boot. Complete the requested
restart before installing the client role on that machine.

The dashboard does not inject demonstration records. It starts with an empty
client registry and displays only records supplied by the runtime registry.
Teachers can switch between `Room screens`, which presents every visible client
in a responsive screen wall, and `Selected client`, which concentrates
telemetry, snapshot controls, screen annotation, lock/unlock, and chat for one
workstation. The snapshot interval is adjustable from 5 to 10 seconds. Each
JPEG is bounded to 60 KiB, and only the newest pending snapshot is retained to
avoid stale queue growth. Teacher-screen broadcast uses the same bounded
snapshot path. The dashboard includes English/Vietnamese and light/dark mode
switches. Minimizing or closing the window keeps the server available in the
Windows notification area; use the tray menu to reopen it or exit. Continuous
H.264/UDP preview remains optional future work.

In `Selected client`, use `Start remote` only when an administrator explicitly
needs input control. The preview forwards mouse movement and left-click events;
the adjacent keyboard field sends ASCII text when Enter is pressed. Remote
control is stopped automatically when the selected client changes, goes offline,
the view changes, or the server exits.

The repository retains a native WFP allowlist foundation, but the unified
installer and current diagnostics helper do not expose an allowlist panel.
WFP operates on destination IPs and ports, so any future policy must resolve and
maintain domain addresses explicitly. No HTTPS interception or MITM decryption
is used.

For the complete installer feature list, script locations, diagnostics options,
and the distinction between the CMake build option `NSTU_BUILD_SETUP` and
runtime arguments, see the [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md). There is no
`--setup` runtime flag; run `diagnostics\nstu-diagnostics.exe` directly when a
technician needs a standalone check.

Server and client are mutually exclusive installation roles on one Windows
machine. The unified installer checks the registered role and installed layout
before copying files, and aborts with an explanatory message if the opposite
role is already present. Use separate machines for the teacher server and
student clients.

Vietnamese and dark mode can also be selected at startup:

```powershell
& "$env:ProgramFiles\NSTU\server\nstu-server.exe" --language=vi --dark
```

### Client

1. Download and run `nstu-<version>-setup.exe` as an administrator, select
   **Install for Client**, and enter the server IP address and control port.
2. The installer runs the client diagnostics, registers `nstu-service` for
   automatic startup, and configures
   service recovery. It deliberately does not start the service inside the
   installer session.
3. Restart Windows when setup requests it. Windows stops at its normal sign-in
   screen; manually select the existing standard classroom account. NSTU, UWF,
   and Managed mode do not create accounts, select an account, store its
   password, or configure automatic sign-in. After sign-in the service launches
   one `nstu-agent.exe` instance in that active user session.
4. An administrator can later verify the service with:

   ```powershell
   Get-Service nstu-service
   ```

The client service is the component that starts automatically. The installer
registers it with Windows `start= auto`; the required restart activates the
service, and the service launches the interactive agent in the logged-on user
session.

`nstu-service.exe` is registered explicitly as `LocalSystem` and runs in
Session 0. `nstu-agent.exe` must remain in the logged-in user's interactive
session so Windows permits tray, capture, overlay, and input operations. A
standard user is not granted service stop/delete access; after an established
agent pipe disconnects, the service attempts a bounded relaunch. NSTU does not
claim to be immune to a local administrator or kernel-level software. See the
[VM lifecycle test guide](docs/VM_TESTING.md) for the exact security assertions.

Use Windows **Installed apps** or the NSTU uninstaller to remove the client.
The first uninstaller invocation only validates the request and stages a
one-shot SYSTEM startup task. It changes no service, process, package file, or
pending-delete state unless the administrator accepts an immediate restart.
After reboot, the task force-terminates NSTU-owned agent/service processes,
deletes the service, removes package files, and schedules any still-locked file
for the following boot. Direct manual service removal is not supported.

## Connecting a computer room

Run the same unified installer on each machine, choosing Server on the teacher
machine and Client on each student machine. Put them on the same trusted VLAN
and allow TCP and UDP traffic on port `47001` between clients and the server.
Enrollment itself is done on screen: no secret file is copied to a student
machine, and no per-client command is run.

The server still needs its protected data root, which the operator helper
scripts in the repository's `packaging\` directory create. The unified installer
ships only the role binaries, their runtimes, the diagnostics helper, and the
exam runtime assets; it does not install PowerShell scripts or documentation.
Run these helpers from a source checkout of the matching release and set
`$deployment` to the checkout's `packaging` directory.

### 1. Prepare the server

Run this on the teacher machine as Administrator to create the protected data
root, then start `nstu-server.exe`:

```powershell
$deployment = Join-Path (Get-Location) "packaging"
if (-not (Test-Path (Join-Path $deployment "configure-data-root.ps1"))) {
  throw "Run this from a source checkout: the packaging helpers are not part of the installed product."
}
& (Join-Path $deployment "configure-data-root.ps1") `
  -DataRoot "$env:ProgramData\NSTU"
```

No enrollment secret is created for the on-screen pairing flow — the server mints
and stores each client's key itself when the operator approves the request.

### 2. Enroll each client by pairing

On the server, open the pairing window ("Add computers"). Each student machine's
agent sweeps the LAN for a server whose pairing window is open, runs the mutually
authenticated exchange itself, and shows a six-digit code on its own screen. The
same code appears in the server's pending list; the operator approves a request
only when the two codes match. **That six-digit comparison is the trust root** —
nothing is copied between machines to establish it.

On approval, the client derives its protocol key from the transcript (the key is
never transmitted), stores the machine-scope DPAPI configuration `nstu-service`
uses, and connects. A trusted client follows this path:

```text
Install client
  -> agent sweeps the LAN and shows a six-digit code
  -> operator approves the matching code on the server (the trust root)
  -> server mints the client key; client stores a protected configuration
  -> authenticate to the server over TCP
  -> register the device and receive an authenticated snapshot schedule and room policy
  -> capture bounded JPEG snapshots over the authenticated TCP connection
```

On a shared VLAN where several servers answer, label each server with a room name
in the server UI and give each student machine its room via the installer's
optional **Room name** field or `/ROOM=` in a silent install (it writes
`HKLM\Software\NSTU\PreferredRoom`). The agent then auto-selects the server
advertising that room, falling back to the selection menu — or to silent pairing
when only one server answers — if no room is set or no single server carries it.
The room name is only a routing hint; the six-digit approval still gates every
pairing, so a wrong or missing room degrades to the menu, never to a silent
mis-pairing.

The optional continuous H.264 path is not part of this enrollment flow. It may
later add authenticated group membership and multicast/unicast transport after
the dedicated switch, decoder, and loss-recovery validation gates pass.

Connection preambles only reject obviously invalid peers quickly. Device
identity is accepted only after the cryptographic handshake succeeds.

### Manual enrollment fallback (advanced)

The earlier file-copy enrollment path is deprecated and no longer shipped in the
installer, but the tools remain in the repository for recovery when on-screen
pairing is unavailable (for example, a machine with no interactive session). From
a source checkout, export a one-time bootstrap secret on the server, then run the
provisioning tool on each machine with a unique 128-bit identity and key ID:

```powershell
$deployment = Join-Path (Get-Location) "packaging"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "D:\SecureTransfer" -Force | Out-Null
& (Join-Path $deployment "new-enrollment-secret.ps1") `
  -ExportPath "D:\SecureTransfer\nstu-enrollment.bin"
# Restart nstu-server.exe so it loads the protected enrollment secret, then on
# each client (nstu-provision.exe is not installed; build it or copy it from a
# source checkout):
$clientId = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("N")
& ".\nstu-provision.exe" 192.168.10.10 47001 $clientId 1 "D:\SecureTransfer\nstu-enrollment.bin"
```

The tool authenticates the enrollment transcript, derives the installed PSK
without sending it, and stores the same machine-scope DPAPI configuration. Keep
the export in a protected removable/thawed location and delete every copy once
enrollment is complete. `new-enrollment-secret.ps1` is server-only; it is not
needed on student machines.

### Staging an exam package

Exam archives are staged on the client only by the administrator-owned helper
`stage-exam-package.ps1`, run from a source checkout's `packaging\` directory. The
server remains the persistent owner of the original package and answer journal.
The helper requires both the release archive SHA-256 and the unpacked content
SHA-256, rejects unsafe ZIP entries and zip bombs, and publishes a
content-addressed directory below the persistent client data root:

~~~powershell
$stager = Join-Path (Get-Location) "packaging\stage-exam-package.ps1"
& $stager -ArchivePath "D:\SecureTransfer\exam.nstuexam" -PublishRoot "$env:ProgramData\NSTU\exams\packages" -ExpectedArchiveSha256 "<archive-sha256>" -ExpectedContentSha256 "<content-sha256>" -TrustedPublisherThumbprint "<publisher-thumbprint>"
~~~

Production packages must contain a detached CMS/PKCS#7 `manifest.p7s`
entry signed by the configured publisher. `-AllowUnsigned` and
`-AllowNonElevatedTest` are internal-test switches only. The helper
does not download packages or modify the server, UWF, or Deep Freeze state.

## Deep Freeze deployments

UWF/reboot-to-restore trials and third-party Deep Freeze protection apply only
to client machines. Never place the teacher server under UWF or Deep Freeze:
exam packages, `exams/answer-journal.bin`, enrollment state, audit records, and
diagnostic data must remain on persistent storage. The client's DPAPI-protected
answer outbox is only a retry buffer; the server journal is authoritative.

- Install binaries in the normal protected Windows location.
- Reserve a thawed, ACL-restricted location for enrolled identity, protected
  key material, configuration, audit logs, and update state.
- Configure that location before enrollment, for example:

  ```powershell
  & (Join-Path (Get-Location) "packaging\configure-data-root.ps1") `
    -DataRoot "D:\NSTUData"
  ```
- Never store PSKs, certificates, dumps, screen captures, or runtime secrets in
  the repository.
- Do not freeze a production image before enrollment persistence, service
  recovery, upgrade, and rollback behavior have been tested.
- Boot the workstation Thawed and disable Deep Freeze protection before
  installing, upgrading, or uninstalling NSTU. The client uninstaller checks
  recognized `DFServ`/`DeepFrz` services and aborts while their protection is
  still active; this conservative check must be validated against the exact
  Deep Freeze edition used by the school.

Named pipes and memory-mapped files reduce temporary disk activity but do not
replace persistent protected storage. Deep Freeze will discard unthawed state
after a reboot.

NSTU's proposed built-in replacement is currently **research only**. The safe
design uses Microsoft's Unified Write Filter rather than an NSTU kernel driver.
Microsoft supports UWF on Enterprise, Education, and IoT Enterprise editions,
but not Windows Pro or Home. Current NSTU builds do not enable, configure, or
control UWF and must not be represented as a Deep Freeze replacement. See the
[reboot-to-restore design](docs/REBOOT_TO_RESTORE.md) for the privilege model,
maintenance/recovery sequence, Windows Pro fallback, and release gates.

## Security notes

- Current control sessions use mutual HMAC authentication and replay
  protection.
- JPEG snapshots and video datagrams are authenticated, but screen content is
  not encrypted. Do not test real sensitive screens on an untrusted LAN.
- Remote control is deliberately disabled until the teacher clicks `Start
  remote`; use it only on enrolled, trusted clients. The WFP website policy is
  IPv4-only and covers TCP ports 80 and 443.
- Authenticode automation is available, but nightly artifacts remain unsigned;
  a production release requires the real certificate-backed workflow.
- Independent review, fuzzing, Deep Freeze edition validation, real certificate
  signing, and the hardware/network evidence matrix remain production blockers.
- A green CI build proves compilation and automated tests, not security or
  reliability on real school hardware.
