# Security Protocol

## Scope

The current security layer provides live authenticated TCP control sessions,
authenticated UDP video packet primitives, replay-resistant bootstrap
enrollment, a persisted machine-scoped keyring, and protected client runtime
configuration. It does not encrypt screen content.

## Control handshake

Each installed client has a 128-bit client ID and references a provisioned key
using `key_id`. The pre-shared key itself must come from protected local machine
storage and must never be committed to the repository.
Protocol keys shorter than 256 bits are rejected.

```text
Client -> Server: AuthHello(client_id, client_nonce, unix_time, key_id)
Server -> Client: AuthChallenge(server_nonce, unix_time)
Client -> Server: HMAC(PSK, labelled transcript)
Server -> Client: HMAC(session_key, labelled transcript)
```

Both nonces are 256-bit values generated with Windows CNG. Client and server
proofs use different domain labels. The session key is also derived under a
separate label, preventing the same HMAC input from being reused across roles.

The server must verify the client MAC before inserting the hello into
`ReplayProtector`. Replay insertion is atomic and bounded. Capacity must be
sized for the maximum accepted handshake rate over the clock-skew interval, and
the TCP listener must separately rate-limit unauthenticated connections.

The blocking `client_handshake` and `server_handshake` implementations now use
the real `TcpSocket` framing path, including receive/send timeouts. A successful
handshake returns a move-only `AuthenticatedSession`; moving it into
`AuthenticatedControlChannel` transfers the session key and clears the source.
Handshake message types are rejected after channel establishment.

Before the first length-prefixed command frame, both peers exchange a fixed
32-byte connection preamble. It contains the protocol magic/version, role,
`client_id`, and `key_id`. The server can reject malformed, wrong-role, or
identity-mismatched connections before allocating a command payload or running
the HMAC proof. Preamble identity is an admission hint only: it is checked
against `AuthHello` and is never trusted without the subsequent HMAC proof.
Preamble parsing is fixed-size and allocation-free; deployments should apply a
short read timeout and per-source rate limit at this boundary.

`security::HandshakeRateLimiter` provides that bounded admission primitive. The
live IOCP listener calls it before admitting a source, records failed handshakes
and invalid framing, clears state after success, and emits structured audit
events. It tracks a source by stable address or enrollment identity, limits failures in a
fixed window, applies a temporary block after the threshold, evicts oldest
entries when the source table is full, and clears state after a successful
handshake. It must be called before `client_handshake`/`server_handshake`; it
does not replace replay protection or HMAC verification.

For local key material, `protect_machine_secret` and
`unprotect_machine_secret` use Windows DPAPI with `CRYPTPROTECT_LOCAL_MACHINE`.
`save_machine_secret` writes an ACL-restricted temporary file, flushes it, and
atomically replaces the destination with `MoveFileExW`. The file ACL grants
full access only to LocalSystem, built-in Administrators, and the file owner.
The PSK and DPAPI entropy remain deployment inputs and are never generated into
the repository.

`security::KeyStore` provides the in-process lifecycle boundary used by a
server key resolver: enrollment rejects weak or reused IDs, rotation allocates a
new monotonic ID before revoking older active keys, and revocation zeroizes key
material while retaining an ID tombstone. `resolve()` returns only active key
copies. `save_keyring` and `load_keyring` serialize active entries and revoked-ID
tombstones into a versioned binary format protected with machine-scope DPAPI,
restrictive ACLs, flush, and atomic replacement.

Initial enrollment uses a one-time 256-bit bootstrap secret. The client sends a
fresh nonce, timestamp, identity, requested key ID, and HMAC. Both peers derive
the installed PSK from the bootstrap secret and transcript, so the PSK itself is
not transmitted. The server applies clock and replay checks before enrollment,
persists the keyring before acknowledging, and rolls back the in-memory change
if persistence fails. `nstu-provision.exe` stores the resulting client runtime
configuration under machine-scope DPAPI. The bootstrap export must be distributed
out of band and deleted after enrollment.

## Authenticated control frames

After the handshake, every command carries:

- a strictly monotonic 64-bit sequence;
- a 128-bit truncated HMAC-SHA256 tag;
- the normal command envelope and payload.

The MAC covers a domain label, serialized command envelope, sequence, and
payload. Because TCP preserves order, `ControlSequenceGuard` requires the exact
next sequence. A reconnect creates a new session key and resets both directions
to independently negotiated initial sequences.

Verify the MAC before applying the sequence guard. Only advance the guard after
successful verification. Do not execute, log as trusted, or acknowledge an
unauthenticated command.

## UDP video authentication

The datagram layout is:

```text
[44-byte video header][16-byte authentication tag][H.264 fragment]
```

The tag is a truncated HMAC-SHA256 over a video-specific domain label, the
serialized header, and payload. Verify it before packet-loss accounting or
frame reassembly; otherwise spoofed packets can corrupt both metrics and video.

One client-derived session key cannot authenticate a shared multicast stream.
The server therefore needs a random video group key, distributed individually
over each authenticated control session. Rotate the group key when membership
changes or according to policy, and allocate a new `stream_id` and sequence
baseline for the rotated stream.

## Reassembly ordering

The required receive order is:

```text
validate datagram length
  -> decode fixed header
  -> select authenticated stream/key
  -> verify video HMAC
  -> packet-loss tracker
  -> frame reassembler
  -> decoder/jitter buffer
```

Neither `PacketLossTracker` nor `FrameReassembler` auto-selects a stream from an
untrusted first datagram. Both must be reset from authenticated control-plane
metadata before UDP reception begins.

## Remaining blockers

- Membership-driven video group-key generation, rotation, and distribution wired
  into live stream startup and UDP reception.
- Confidentiality: HMAC authenticates but does not encrypt screen content.
  AES-GCM group encryption or an equivalent design is required where LAN users
  must not be able to view captured traffic.
- Independent protocol review and fuzzing before deployment.
