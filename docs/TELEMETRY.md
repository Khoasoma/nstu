# Optional Diagnostics and Public Reports

[English](TELEMETRY.md) | [Tiếng Việt](TELEMETRY.vi.md)

NSTU Server includes an opt-in diagnostic collection mode for troubleshooting
graphics, snapshot decoding, and other bounded server errors. It is disabled by
default and is not a remote telemetry service.

## Consent and data flow

1. A teacher or technician explicitly enables **Collect privacy-filtered
   diagnostics locally** in `Settings`.
2. NSTU keeps at most 64 recent sanitized events in process memory.
3. If **Prompt when an error report is ready** is enabled, the first error in a
   collected batch opens the report-review popup. Clearing the batch or
   re-enabling the prompt rearms it, preventing a repeating graphics error from
   reopening the popup every frame. Otherwise the operator can open the report
   from `Settings` or `Diagnostics`.
4. The operator reviews the complete Markdown report and can copy it.
5. **Copy and open GitHub** copies the text and opens the public GitHub Issue
   form. The operator must paste, review, and submit it manually.

NSTU does not embed a GitHub credential, create an issue in the background, or
transmit the report to an NSTU endpoint. Closing the application discards the
in-memory events. Disabling collection clears them immediately.

The existing bounded graphics log used by the local `Diagnostics` window and
startup failure message remains available even when public-report collection is
off. It is process-local, is not included in a shareable report while collection
is disabled, and is discarded when NSTU exits.

## Included fields

The report uses a strict application-owned field list:

- NSTU application version and build channel;
- D3D11 device mode, graphics adapter/vendor, and feature level;
- Desktop Duplication availability and the number of registered hardware H.264
  encoders;
- configured snapshot interval;
- a bucketed client count (`0`, `1-10`, `11-25`, `26-50`, or `51+`);
- up to 64 recent internal diagnostic events after local sanitization.

The report intentionally excludes exact client counts above zero to reduce
environment fingerprinting.

## Excluded data

Do not add any of the following to a public report:

- IP addresses, MAC addresses, client IDs, host names, user names, or school
  names;
- local/UNC paths, credentials, enrollment secrets, tokens, or private keys;
- screenshots, screen contents, chat messages, or remote-control input;
- exam packages, questions, answers, candidate identity, grading data, or answer
  recovery journals;
- dumps or unrestricted application logs.

The sanitizer removes common forms of IP/MAC address, path, email, secret,
credential assignment, and numeric client-reference data. This is defense in
depth, not permission to collect arbitrary user content. Event producers must
still use controlled, non-user-authored diagnostic messages.

## Controls and storage

The server stores only the two consent choices under the interactive operator's
profile:

```text
HKCU\Software\NSTU\Server\TelemetryEnabled
HKCU\Software\NSTU\Server\TelemetryPromptOnError
```

Both values are `REG_DWORD`. The default for a missing value is disabled. No
event payload is written to the registry or disk.

## Current scope

This implementation is server-side only. A Session 0 client service must never
show consent on behalf of a student or silently publish machine diagnostics.
Any future fleet-reporting design requires administrator policy, authenticated
transport, a documented retention period, aggregation on the persistent server,
and a separate privacy/security review before it can be enabled.

## Reporting safely

GitHub Issues are public. Before submitting:

1. read every report line;
2. remove anything identifying a person, device, school, or network;
3. describe reproduction steps without names or addresses;
4. attach no screenshot, dump, exam material, or unrestricted log;
5. submit only if the school or organization permits public disclosure.

Security vulnerabilities or reports containing sensitive data must not be filed
through the public diagnostic template. Use a private maintainer channel or
GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available; see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Activity audit log (distinct from telemetry)

NSTU also keeps an operational **activity audit log**, which is not the same as
the opt-in public diagnostics described above and not the same as the exam
answer journal. The audit log records that NSTU activity happened - enrollment,
managed-mode changes, UWF fleet operations, exam authorization, session and
security events - with a category, severity, component, action, result, and
bounded sanitized detail. It never records exam questions, answer bodies,
screenshots, chat or remote-input contents, credentials, secrets, keys, SAS
codes, tokens, raw file paths, or raw network identifiers: every field is passed
through the same public-text sanitizer plus a hard denylist before it is written
or sent.

Client activity is spooled with a bounded, drop-oldest queue and uploaded to the
server in small, rate-limited, sequence-acknowledged chunks. The server persists
records centrally to a rotating newline-delimited sink. This is always-on
operational record keeping, separate from the consent-gated diagnostics above.

## Assessment discrete timing telemetry (distinct from diagnostics and audit logs)

For computer-based examinations, NSTU provides a dedicated, non-invasive **discrete timing telemetry pipeline** operating alongside the exam response flow.

Unlike the opt-in server diagnostics (which capture graphics/crash events for manual GitHub issues) and the operational activity audit log (which records system lifecycle state changes), assessment timing telemetry measures candidate engagement patterns during active exams (dwell time per question, time-to-first-answer, selection change counts, blur/focus transitions, and scroll depth).

Key architectural boundaries:
- **Zero-Raw-Input guarantee**: strictly excludes keystroke logging, clipboard inspection, raw mouse trajectories, and response text.
- **Channel and storage isolation**: uses dedicated commands (`exam_telemetry_batch` / `exam_telemetry_ack`) and a separate 8×8 MiB rotating journal (`exams/telemetry-journal`), preventing telemetry traffic or disk utilization from ever delaying answer event submissions.
- **Investigative evidence only**: missing or incomplete telemetry is treated strictly as unobserved, never as evidence of misconduct.
